# Question
What's an example of when RegEx would solve a problem that would be difficult to solve with other tools?

# Answer
RegEx can solve problems like email or phone validation. Rather than making a bunch of if/else statements to validate each character you can use like 5 RegEx expressions to do the same thing.

# Teacher Feedback

Yup! One small fix, you wouldn't use 5 RegEx expressions, you would use one expression with different flags and patterns to look for.
