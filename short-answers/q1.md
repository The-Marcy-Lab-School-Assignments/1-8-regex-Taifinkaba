# Question
`replaceAll` is a handy new function that will match all instances of a given pattern. But what is the regex that will allow `replace` to get *all* instances of a pattern?

# Answer
`/g` will allow `replace` to get *all* instances of a pattern. `g` stands for global and makes it check everything, not just the first instance.
